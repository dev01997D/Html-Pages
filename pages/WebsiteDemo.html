                <h2>First article: Definite Article</h2>
                <p>The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing.
                    For example, your friend might ask, “Are you going to the party this weekend?” The definite article
                    tells you that your friend is referring to a specific party that both of you know about.
                    The definite article can be used with singular, plural, or uncountable nouns.
                    Below are some examples of the definite article the used in context:</p>
                <p>Example: Please give me the hammer.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Second Article: The Indefinite Article</h2>
                <p>The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a
                    consonant. It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article
                    indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. For example, you
                    might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you
                    are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item. “I am going to bring an apple pie,”
                    your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a
                    specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only
                    appears with singular nouns. Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:
                </p>
                <p>Example : Please hand me a book; any book will do.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Third Article: Exceptions: Choosing A or An</h2>
                <p>There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and
                    an before words that begin with vowels. The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a
                    consonant, but it’s unpronounced. In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel
                    sound. Therefore, we use an. Consider the example sentence below for an illustration of this
                    concept.
                </p>
                <p>Correct: My mother is a honest woman.</p>
                <p>Incorrect: My mother is an honest woman.</p>
